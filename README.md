## 🌟 Why Money Control?

Most finance apps are cluttered, invasive, or just plain ugly. **Money Control** is different. We built a modern, privacy-first financial companion that combines beautiful design with powerful automation.

### 🔒 Privacy First
Your financial data belongs to you. Money Control works **offline-first**, storing your data securely on your device. We don't sell your data to advertisers.

### 🤖 Intelligent Automation (Pro)
Stop manually entering every coffee you buy. Our **Pro** tier uses advanced on-device machine learning to read your bank SMS and automatically categorize your transactions. It's magic.

### 🎨 Beautiful by Design
Enjoy a stunning, glassmorphic interface that makes managing money a delight, not a chore. With smooth animations and full support for Dark Mode, it looks good at any time of day.
